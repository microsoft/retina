# Basic Metrics TSG

## Overview

Basic metrics is covered by the [Metrics](../metrics/intro.md) section of the Retina documentation. This guide is intended to help you troubleshoot issues with basic metrics.

## Metrics are not being generated or showing up in Grafana dashboards

If you are not seeing metrics in Grafana, it is likely that the metrics are not being generated. To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the following:

### Check Retina Pods are running

Check that all Retina Pods are running. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=retina
```

If any of the pods are not running, you can describe the Pod to see what the issue is. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl describe pod -n kube-system <retina pod name>
```

### Check Retina Pod Logs

If retina Pods are running, you can check the logs for the Pod to see what the issue is. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl logs -n kube-system <retina pod name>
```

you should see log lines like the following:

```shell
2023-04-15T23:52:08.046Z        info    dropreason      dropreason/dropreason_linux.go:208      DropReason data collection complete
2023-04-16T00:10:55.598Z        info    linuxutil       linuxutil/linuxutil.go:100      Updated ethTool metrics
```

### Check Retina ConfigMap

If not then the plugin is not running correctly. Please check retina config map and make sure the plugins is enabled.

```shell
kubectl get configmap retina-config -n kube-system -oyaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config.yaml: |-
    apiServer:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 10093

  ```

### Check Retina Metrics are being generated

You can check that metrics are being generated by calling the metrics endpoint. You can do this by running the following command from inside one of the nodes:

```shell
curl http://<retina-pod-ip>:10093/metrics | grep -i retina
```

You should see metrics like the following:

```shell
# HELP retina_forward_bytes Total forwarded bytes
# TYPE retina_forward_bytes gauge
retina_forward_bytes{direction="egress"} 1.9064666952e+10
retina_forward_bytes{direction="ingress"} 2.3619602627e+10

retina_tcp_connection_remote{address="10.224.0.105",port="7070"} 1
# HELP retina_tcp_connection_stats TCP connections Statistics
# TYPE retina_tcp_connection_stats gauge
retina_tcp_connection_stats{statistic_name="DelayedACKLocked"} 107
# HELP retina_tcp_state number of active TCP connections by state
# TYPE retina_tcp_state gauge
retina_tcp_state{state="CLOSE_WAIT"} 1
retina_tcp_state{state="ESTABLISHED"} 16
retina_tcp_state{state="FIN_WAIT1"} 1
retina_tcp_state{state="FIN_WAIT2"} 1

retina_tcp_state{state="TIME_WAIT"} 89
# HELP retina_udp_connection_stats UDP connections Statistics
# TYPE retina_udp_connection_stats gauge
retina_udp_connection_stats{statistic_name="ACTIVE"} 5
```

If you are not seeing metrics like the above, then the plugin is not running correctly. Please check retina config map and make sure the plugins is enabled.

### Check if Managed Prometheus is scraping Retina metrics

If you are using managed Prometheus, you can check if it is scraping the retina metrics by following below steps.

1. Check if AMA-Metrics Pods are running

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l dsName=ama-metrics-node
    ```

2. If they are running, then port forward one of the AMA metrics Pods to see if it can identify retina Pods

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n kube-system <ama-metrics-pod-name> 9090:9090
    ```

3. Open the following URL in your browser to see if retina Pods are being discovered

    ```shell
    http://localhost:9090/targets
    ```

    ![alt text](imgs/prometheus-retina-targets.png)

    a. check if service discovery is recognizing retina Pods

    ```shell
    http://localhost:9090/service-discovery#retina-pods
    ```

    ![alt text](imgs/prom-retina-service-discovery.png)

4. If Retina Pods are not discovered then please check prometheus configuration and make sure the Retina Pod's job is added to the scrape config.

    ```shell
    http://localhost:9090/config
    ```

    ![alt text](imgs/prom-retina-config.png)

5. If the Retina Pod's scrape job is not present in prom config, please check ama-metrics-node config map for the presence of this job or the setting called

    ```shell
    kubectl get configmap ama-metrics-prometheus-config-node -n kube-system -oyaml
    ```
