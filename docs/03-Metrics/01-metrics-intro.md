# Metrics

Prometheus metrics available depend on the Retina control plane deployed.

## Control Planes

There are two control planes used in the Retina project: Hubble and the standard control plane. Both control planes create metrics and traces which are generated by the eBPF data plane, which has a single implementation. Only one control plane should be deployed at a given time. Helm charts for the deployment are found under `deploy/hubble/manifests/controller/helm/retina` and `deploy/standard/manifests/controller/helm/retina`.

2. [standard metrics](./modes/modes.md)

> Note: Hubble offers additional features and metrics that the standard control plane does not support. The plan is to deprecate the standard control plane in favor of Hubble. For further documentation on Hubble, check [Cilium/Hubble repository](https://github.com/cilium/hubble/?tab=readme-ov-file#features) and official [Hubble metrics documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/metrics/#hubble-metrics)
