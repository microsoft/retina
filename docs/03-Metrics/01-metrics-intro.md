# Metrics

Prometheus metrics available depend on the Retina control plane deployed.

## Control Planes

There are two control planes used in the Retina project: Hubble and the legacy control plane. Both control planes create metrics and traces which are generated by the eBPF data plane, which has a single implementation. Only one control plane should be deployed at a given time. Helm charts for the deployment are found under `deploy/hubble/manifests/controller/helm/retina` and `deploy/legacy/manifests/controller/helm/retina`.

2. [Legacy metrics](./modes/modes.md)

> Note: Hubble offers additional features and metrics that the legacy control plane does not support. The plan is to deprecate the legacy control plane in favor of Hubble. For further documentation on Hubble, check [Cilium/Hubble repository](https://github.com/cilium/hubble/?tab=readme-ov-file#features) and official [Hubble metrics documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/metrics/#hubble-metrics)
