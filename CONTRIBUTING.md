# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
This document outlines the requirements for contributors and their contributions and provides other general information about contributing to Retina.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.
For details, visit [https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment).
Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot.
You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Cryptographic Signing of Commits

In order to certify the provenance of commits and defend against impersonation, we require that all commits be cryptographically signed.
Documentation for setting up Git and Github to sign your commits can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
Additional information about Git's use of GPG can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)

## Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Contributions to Retina must contain a Developers Certificate of Origin within their constituent commits.
This can be accomplished by providing a `-s` flag to `git commit` as documented [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s).
This will add a `Signed-off-by` trailer to your Git commit, affirming your acceptance of the Contributor License Agreement.

## More info

Getting started guides, community meetings, and more can be found on the [Retina website](https://retina.sh/docs/contributing).
