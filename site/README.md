# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Development

When adding a new doc, make sure to add it to `/site/sidebars.js` to display it in the sidebar.

> Prerequisite: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To test your changes, run `make docs` from the root directory to spin up local webserver and view changes with hot reload.
